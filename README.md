# Langley Park Civic Association Website Evaluation and Redesign 

The purpose of this project is to take the previously deployed Langley Park website and restructure it to meet the needs of the client, the Langley Park Civic Association. This includes adding new features, such as a map, and updating the current features. 

In this repository, you will find documentation for the project, along with the code used when implementing the website. The site was constructed on Wix, though there was some HTML and JavaScript that was implemented into the site. The site link is provided on the repository.
