# Langley Park Civic Association Website Evaluation and Redesign 


In this repository, you will find documentation for the project, along with the code used when implementing the website. The site was constructed on Wix, though there was some HTML and JavaScript that was implemented into the site. The site link is provided on the repository. 

## Abstract

The scope of this project was to enhance the current website of the Langley Park Civic Association to better serve its residents. Our tasks 
include improving existing features, such as the branding, and adding new features, including an interactive map for residents and integrating 
donation links directly to their bank account through the site. Ideally, this will help the association secure resources from the government and 
institutions of higher education, such as the University of Maryland. 


## Project Scope

Our project scope was substantial. This included enhancing the current website of the Langley Park Civic Association to better serve its 
residents, improving existing website features, working on site branding, adding new website features, working with the other LPCA group to
build an interactive map for residents, and integrating paypal donation links and QR codes. Overall, we hope to assist the association in 
securing resources from the government and higher institutions like the University of Maryland.


## Deliverables

Our deliverables closely followed the project scope. This included an overhaul of the current website design, improving a lot of areas in 
desktop/mobile such as the logo, header, front page, about page, and donate page, and integrating a Paypal donation system with QR codes for use 
on web, printed materials, and social media. Additionally, we integrated an interactive map for the Service Directory that shows boundaries of 
parks, small businesses, and highlights green spaces, helping residents navigate the community, find local amenities, and report issues. 


## Methodology

As previous developers built the LPCA website using Wix, we continued to improve the site through the Wix platform, which is a relatively
easy to use content management system. Wix provides an interactive interface to edit websites, allows for backups and page versioning, and
is very customizeable and extendable in terms of plugins offered. Most of the page redesigns were completed through Wix in accordance with the 
prototypes provided by the UI/UX designers that were agreed upon by the clients. For the embedded social wall, we used a Wix plugin for social 
media integration. As for the donation functionality, we simply linked a few buttons in the site to the LPCA Paypal. We agreed with the other 
LPCA group that the Service Directory should be built via Leaflet.js, which is a versatile Javascript library capable of displaying many locations, 
and allows for search bar functionality as well as location grouping, that we later uploaded through the backend and integrated with the main site.
